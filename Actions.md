# What are Actions?

Actions are one of the key building blocks of github actions.

**_An Action is a (custom or a third party) application that performs (typically complex) frequently repeated task._**

Like for example fetching the code from a github repository and downloading it onto such a runnedr machine.

You can build your own actions or create new actions and even sell them into the mraketplace.

An alternative to such an action is a command that's defined with the help of the "run" keyword in your YAML file.

**_With this run command we can execute (typically simple) shell command that's defined by you._**

In Github aActions Marketplace you can browse through different actions.
